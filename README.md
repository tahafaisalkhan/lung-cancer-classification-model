# Lung Cancer Severity Prediction

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to predict the severity of lung cancer in patients using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes various data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing and comparing different machine learning algorithms to find the best predictive model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
5. **Prediction**: Using the best model to predict the severity of lung cancer in new patients.

## Code and Methodology
The code is structured in a Jupyter Notebook (`project.ipynb`), which includes:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Data preprocessing steps
- EDA visualizations and insights
- Building and evaluating machine learning models

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the step-by-step implementation.

## Results
The results section discusses the performance of the different models and highlights the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.
